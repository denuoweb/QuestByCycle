# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS for /docs

## Scope
These rules apply to everything within the `docs/` directory.

## Documentation Style
- Write in Markdown using clear headings (`#`, `##`, etc.).
- Keep lines under **120 characters**.
- Use concise paragraphs and bulleted lists where appropriate.
- Code samples should be fenced with triple backticks and the language name.
- File names should remain uppercase with the `.md` extension, matching the
  existing convention (e.g., `DEVELOPER.md`).

## Content Guidelines
- Keep documentation up to date with the codebase.
- Explain configuration options referenced in `config.toml` or the application.
- When adding new features, update or create documentation describing how to use
  them from both user and developer perspectives.
- Do not remove existing documentation unless it has become obsolete and the
  removal is noted in the commit message.
