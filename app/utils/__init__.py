        Verifying and Earning "Carbon Reduction" Points:

        Sign In and Access Quests: Log into the game, navigate to the homepage,
        and scroll down on the main game page to see the quest list.
        Complete a Quest: Choose by clicking on a quest from the list, and after
        completion, click "Verify Quest". You will need to upload a picture as
        proof of your achievement and/or you can add a comment about your
        experience.
        Submit Verification: After uploading your verification photo and adding
        a comment, click the "Submit Verification" button. You should receive a
        confirmation message indicating your quest completion has been updated.
        Your image will appear at the bottom of the page and it will be
        automatically uploaded to Quest by Cycleâ€™s social Media accounts.
        Social Media Interaction: The uploaded photo will be shared on
        QuestByCycleâ€™s Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram pages. You can view and
        expand thumbnail images of completed quests by others, read comments, and
        visit their profiles by clicking on the images. Use the social media
        buttons to comment and engage with the community.
        Explore the Leaderboard: Check the dynamic leaderboard to see the
        progress of players and teams. The community-wide impact is displayed via
        a "thermometer" showing collective carbon reduction efforts. Clicking on
        a player's name reveals their completed quests and badges.

        Earning Badges:

        Quest Categories: Each quest belongs to a category. Completing all quests
        in a category earns you a badge. The more quests you complete, the higher
        your chances of earning badges.
        Quest Limits: The quest detail popup provides completion limits. If you
        reach the limit set for a quest, you will earn a badge.

        Social Media Interaction:

        Quest Entries: Engage with the community by commenting and sharing your
        achievements on social media platforms directly through the game. Click
        on the thumbnail images at the bottom of a Quest to view user's
        submissions. At the bottom, there will be buttons to take you to
        Facebook, X, and Instagram where you can comment on various quests that
        have been posted and communicate with other players. Through friendly
        competition, let's strive to reduce carbon emissions and make a positive
        impact on the atmosphere.
